User Stories
A user story describes how users will interact with your application
They have the form: As a ___, I want to _, because ____.
eg. As a user, I want to be able to save posts, because I want to review them later.
User stories can also be negated: As a __, I shouldn't be able to _, because ___.
eg. As a user, I shouldn't be able to edit other users posts, because I don't own those posts.

As a user, I want to see what options I have for activities/services from a list of available maps, because I want to know what options are near me.
